Core --> Application Service
=====================

This is where you place your business logic. You can reference the inne libraries as you wish.
This is in most cases an empty library if your not making any kind of services to serve a front end.

In a ASP.NET MVC context you may consider putting your controllers here...

In case you wanna make a Web API this is where you place controllers, presenting DTO's for the client application.
